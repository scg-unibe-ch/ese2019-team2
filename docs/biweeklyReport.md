## Current Project Status

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/scg-unibe-ch/ese2019-team2)

- First implementation of the login and register form in the front end.
  
- Two new pages (/login, /register) consisting of the required inputs

- Auth service, which will be responsible for all the authentication functions/ communicating with the backend /users/login or /users/register api.

- Started a Trello and a Slack Team for communication purposes

## Biggest challenges and risks

- Team communication was/is the biggest challenge. Tried to overcome it by using Trello, Slack and Whatsapp.

- Learning all the framework basics we need to know as we will split up the work later so everyone learns the basics. But that means everyone has to know the basics of the used technologies.
  
- Making a good plan. Even if we'd like to commit to specific features as late as possible and make the decision when we really need them (making it like agile methodology wants us to do it), we need to have the basic project requirements and featureset all the same.

- Risk: Splitting up the work too late would probably result in a heavy workload for few people and not be evenly distributed

## Learning outcomes

- Learned technologies
  - Learned Angular and Ionic and with it how the frontend could work
  - Learned nodejs and express to see the backend function
  - Saw the communication between the backend and front end with a REST api

- Learned that the team communication is a skill that we have to train a lot if we want the project to be successful
